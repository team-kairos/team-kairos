이중적분과 삼중적분에서 어려움을 겪는 것은 부피를 구하는 영역 자체를 이해하는 것, 그 이후의 적분구간의 설정과 적분 순서의 결정입니다. 이러한 부분에 ChatGPT가 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 영역을 주고 ChatGPT에게 답변을 받아봅시다.

To find the volume of the region enclosed by the cylinders $z = x^2$, $y = x^2$, and the planes $z = 0$, $y = 4$, we can set up a triple integral.

>

> Finally, integrate with respect to $x$:

> $$ V = \int_{-2}^{2} (4x^2 - x^4) \, dx $$  
>   
> $$ V = \int_{-2}^{2} 4x^2 \, dx - \int_{-2}^{2} x^4 \, dx $$  
>   
> $$ V = \left[ \frac{4}{3}x^3 \right]_{-2}^{2} - \left[ \frac{1}{5}x^5 \right]_{-2}^{2} $$  
>   
> $$ V = \left[ \frac{4}{3}(2^3) - \frac{1}{5}(2^5) \right] - \left[ \frac{4}{3}(-2^3) - \frac{1}{5}(-2^5) \right] $$  
>   
> $$ V = \left[ \frac{32}{3} - \frac{32}{5} \right] + \left[ \frac{32}{3} + \frac{32}{5} \right] $$  
>   
> $$ V = 2\left( \frac{32}{3} - \frac{32}{5} \right) $$  
>

> $$ \frac{32}{3} - \frac{32}{5} = \frac{160}{15} - \frac{96}{15} = \frac{64}{15} $$  
>   
> $$ V = 2 \times \frac{64}{15} = \frac{128}{15} $$  
>   
> $$ V = \frac{8 \times 16}{15} = \frac{128}{15} = 8\frac{8}{15} $$  
>   
> So, the volume of the region is $8\frac{8}{15}$ cubic units.
