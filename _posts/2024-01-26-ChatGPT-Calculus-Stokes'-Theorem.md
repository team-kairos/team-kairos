> Use Stokes' Theorem to evaluate $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$. In each case $C$ is oriented counterclockwise as viewed from above, unless otherwise stated : $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)=x^2 y \mathbf{i}+x^3 \mathbf{j}+e^z \tan ^{-1} z \mathbf{k}$, $C$ is the curve with parametric equations $x=\cos t, y=\sin t$, $z=\sin t, 0 \leqslant t \leqslant 2 \pi$

This complexity arises from the trigonometric and exponential functions involved in the vector field and the curve.

손풀이한 내용과 비교해보니, 중간 과정에서 ChatGPT가 curl $\mathbf F$를 잘못 계산한 것 같아 이를 지적합니다. 지적할 때에는 지적사항만 간단히 말해도 됩니다.

The recalculated curl of the vector field $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)=x^2 y \mathbf{i}+x^3 \mathbf{j}+e^z \tan ^{-1} z \mathbf{k}$ still simplifies to zero. This means the integral of $\mathbf{F}$ along the curve $C$ should also be zero according to Stokes' Theorem.  
>   
> However, if you believe the curl of $\mathbf{F}$ should be $(0, 0, 2x^2)$, let's manually calculate the curl of $\mathbf{F}$ to verify this.

>  Let's calculate this determinant for $\mathbf{F}$.  
> You are correct. The curl of the vector field $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)=x^2 y \mathbf{i}+x^3 \mathbf{j}+e^z \tan ^{-1} z \mathbf{k}$ is indeed $(0, 0, 2x^2)$.

> The evaluated surface integral of $2x^2$ over the disk $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ in the $xy$-plane, using Stokes' Theorem, is approximately $1.5708$. This value is the result of the line integral of the vector field $\mathbf{F}(x, y, z)=x^2 y \mathbf{i}+x^3 \mathbf{j}+e^z \tan ^{-1} z \mathbf{k}$ along the curve $C$ with parametric equations $x=\cos t, y=\sin t, z=\sin t$ for $0 \leqslant t \leqslant 2 \pi$.

처음에는 지적사항을 반박하는가 싶더니, 정확히 다시 확인해보는 절차를 걸친 뒤, 잘못된 것을 확인하고 사과합니다. 그 이후로는 정확한 풀이과정을 제시하였습니다.  
그런데 $\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d \mathbf{r}$를 어떻게 계산하는지가 궁금했기 때문에,

> Certainly! Let's break down the last calculation step by step:  
>   
> 1. **Curl in Polar Coordinates**:   
>    The curl of the vector field $\mathbf{F}$ was found to be $(0, 0, 2x^2)$. For the $k$-component, $2x^2$, we converted this into polar coordinates because the surface $S$ is a disk in the $xy$-plane. In polar coordinates, $x = r\cos(\theta)$ and $y = r\sin(\theta)$. So, $2x^2$ becomes $2r^2\cos^2(\theta)$.  
>   
> 2. **Choosing the Surface $S$**:  
>    We chose the surface $S$ to be the disk in the $xy$-plane bounded by the curve $C$. This disk can be represented in polar coordinates as $0 \leq r \leq 1$ and $0 \leq \theta \leq 2\pi$, corresponding to the entire area of a unit circle.  
>   
> 3. **Surface Integral in Polar Coordinates**:   
>    The surface integral of a scalar function over a surface in polar coordinates is given by $\iint_S f(r, \theta) \, r \, dr \, d\theta$, where $r \, dr \, d\theta$ is the area element in polar coordinates.  
>   
> 4. **Setting Up the Integral**:  
>    We set up the integral of $2r^2\cos^2(\theta)$ over the unit disk. The integral becomes:  
>    $$\int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{1} 2r^2\cos^2(\theta) \, r \, dr \, d\theta$$  
>   
> 5. **Evaluating the Integral**:  
>    The integral is evaluated in two steps: first with respect to $r$ from 0 to 1, and then with respect to $\theta$ from 0 to $2\pi$. This double integral computes the total flux of the curl of $\mathbf{F}$ through the surface $S$.  
>   
> 6. **Result**:  
>    The result of the integral, approximately $1.5708$, is the value of the line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ along the curve $C$ as per Stokes' Theorem.  
>   
> In summary, we converted the problem into polar coordinates for ease of computation, chose an appropriate surface $S$, and then evaluated the surface integral of the curl of $\mathbf{F}$ over $S$, which, according to Stokes' Theorem, equals the line integral of $\mathbf{F}$ along $C$.
